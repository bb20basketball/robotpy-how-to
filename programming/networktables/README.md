## Networktables ##

Networktables is the magic that sends data between your robot and a laptop. You can send any data you can image like sensor readings and match time.

Networktables requires you to setup "tables". These tables is where your data is. Most often in past years, I named my table "SmartDashboard" because there is also a Java Smart Dashboard that uses the same table name. So, if it can to you, you could also use the Java Dashboard. The Java Dashboard is much worse because it isn't web based and requires heavy code to even do the simplest of things.
