## Get Started Programming ##

*Start this part of the guide only when everything is installed both on the laptop and on the robot.*

I suggest anyone wanting to program the robot to complete the Codecademy course of Python. If you don't take that course, you will be lost and not understand what is happening.

Templates in the directory include:

1. Basic West Coast Drive

2. Basic Pneumatics

3. Basic Autonomous Mode

4. Basic Webcam

5. Advanced Programming Practices

6. Common Problems and Fixes Doc

#### There is also the complete code from previous years to look at. ####

1. [Our 2015 Code](https://github.com/bb20basketball/2015-Team4480-Code) (It was really simple stuff, one file)

2. [Our 2016 Code](https://github.com/bb20basketball/2016-RobotCode) (More complex, but in one huge file)

3. [Our Beautiful 2017 Code](https://github.com/bb20basketball/2017-Robot-Code) (Very complex, many files and components, super clean)
