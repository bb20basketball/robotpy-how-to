## Get Started Programming ##

*Start this part of the guide only when everything is installed both on the laptop and on the robot.*

I suggest anyone wanting to program the robot to complete the codecademy course of Python. If you don't take that course, you will be lost and not understand what is happening.

Templates in the directory include:

1. Basic West Coast Drive

2. Basic Pneumatics

3. Basic Autonomous Mode

4. Basic Webcam
