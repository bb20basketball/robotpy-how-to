## Basic Webcam ##

In many games, a Webcam can be very useful for the driver to see what they are doing. We also have a great big driver station monitor made just for this purpose of being able to see where your eyesight fails you.

There is two main approaches in RobotPy to this issue and I've used both.

1. Use code to send back the webcam stream

2. Use mjpg-streamer to send back webcam stream
