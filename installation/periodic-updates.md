## Periodic Updates ##

During the build season, there are new updates about every few weeks that can help solve problems and increase performance, particularly in the first few weeks.

The RoboRIO RobotPy installation and the Laptop PyFRC Laptop installation is usually what needs to be updated the most frequently.

### RobotPy on roboRIO ###

1. [Download the latest RobotPy release Zip file](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/releases)

2. Extract and go to where it extracted. Most likely 1. Go to `Downloads/robotpy-VERSION_NUMBER/robotpy-VERSION_NUMBERs/` where the VERSION_NUMBER will be like 2017.1.2

2. Connect to the robotâ€™s WiFi network and type `py -3 installer.py install-robotpy`

### PyFRC on Laptop ###

1. Open up the "pip for windows" program on the laptop. Make sure the interpreter is on `C:/Python27/python.exe`. Now, simply type in `pip install --upgrade pyfrc`
